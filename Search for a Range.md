# Question - Search for a Range
Given a sorted array of integers A(0 based index) of size N, find the starting and ending position of a given integar B in array A.
Your algorithmâ€™s runtime complexity must be in the order of O(log n).
Return an array of size 2, such that first element = starting position of B in A and second element = ending position of B in A, 
if B is not found in A return [-1, -1].

Constraints:
1 <= N <= 10^6
1 <= A[i], B <= 10^9

# Input Description:
First line consists of a single number n.
Second line consists of an array of n elements.
Third line consists of a single integer B.

# Output Description:
Return an array of size 2, such that first element = starting position of B in A and second element = ending position of B in A, 
if B is not found in A return [-1, -1].

# Explanation:
Return an array of size 2, such that first element = starting position of B in A and second element = ending position of B in A, 
if B is not found in A return [-1, -1].

# Hints:
Return an array of size 2, such that first element = starting position of B in A and second element = ending position of B in A, 
if B is not found in A return [-1, -1].

Solution:

```python

def start_end(n1, n2):
  pass

```
